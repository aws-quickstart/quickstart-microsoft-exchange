Microsoft Exchange Server is a messaging and collaboration product that supports mailboxes, calendars, compliance, and archives. In an Exchange Server environment, you can collaborate and—when you deploy the environment to AWS—scale environments based on demand.

The AWS Cloud provides infrastructure services that enable you to deploy Exchange Server in a highly available and fault-tolerant way. By deploying to AWS, you get the functionality of Exchange Server and the flexibility and security of AWS.

In addition to this Partner Solution, we published a set of Microsoft-based Partner Solutions that you can use to deploy other common Microsoft workloads to AWS:

* Microsoft Active Directory
* Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway)
* Microsoft SharePoint Server
* Microsoft Web Application Proxy with Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)

Each Partner Solution includes a virtual private cloud (VPC) environment, which is deployed based on AWS best practices. For more information, refer to the https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/[Partner Solution catalog^].
