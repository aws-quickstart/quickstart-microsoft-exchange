[[storage-on-the-exchange-nodes]]
==== Storage on the Exchange Nodes

Storage capacity and performance are key aspects of any production installation. Although capacity and performance vary from one deployment to the next, this Quick Start provides a reference configuration that you can use as a starting point. The AWS CloudFormation template deploys the Exchange nodes using the memory-optimized r5.xlarge instance type by default.

To provide highly performant and durable storage, we’ve also included Amazon EBS volumes in this reference architecture. EBS volumes are network-attached disk storage, which you can create and attach to EC2 instances. Once these are attached, you can create a file system on top of these volumes, run a mailbox database, or use them in any other way you would use a block device. EBS volumes are placed in a specific Availability Zone, where they are automatically replicated to protect you from the failure of a single component.

Provisioned IOPS EBS volumes offer storage with consistent and low-latency performance. They are backed by solid state drives (SSDs) and are designed for applications with I/O-intensive workloads such as databases.

Amazon EBS-optimized instances, such as the R5 instance type, deliver dedicated throughput between Amazon EC2 and Amazon EBS. The dedicated throughput minimizes contention between Amazon EBS I/O and other traffic from your Amazon EC2 instance, and provides the best performance for your EBS volumes.

By default, on each Exchange node, the Quick Start deploys three 500-GiB General Purpose (GP2) SSD volumes to store mailbox databases and transaction logs. The database and log partitions are formatted using GUID Partition Table ( GPT).

By default, partitions are created using Resilient File System (ReFS), which is the Preferred Architecture (PA) choice for Exchange Server 2016 and Exchange Server 2019. If you set the Enable or disable ReFS parameter to *false*, the partitions are formatted using NTFS.

The GP2 volume type delivers a consistent baseline of 3 IOPS/GiB, which provides a total of 1,500 IOPS per volume for Exchange database and transaction log volumes. You can customize the volume size, and you can switch to using dedicated IOPS volumes.

If you need more IOPS per volume, consider using Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes by changing the *Exchange Server Volume Type* and *Exchange Server Volume IOPS* parameters, or use disk striping within Windows.

The default disk layout in this Quick Start uses the following EBS volumes:

* One General Purpose SSD volume (100 GiB) for the operating system (C:)
* One General Purpose SSD volume (500 GiB) to host the Exchange Server database files (D:)
* One General Purpose SSD volume (500 GiB) to host the Exchange Server transaction log files (E:)

The following figure shows the disk layout on each Exchange Server node:

[#architecture3]
.Disk layout on Exchange Server node
image::../docs/operational_guide/images/image3.png[Architecture,width=521,height=172]

*Note* You’ll find the installation software on each node in the *C:\Exchangeinstall* folder.

Depending on the instance type selected, you might see additional drives for instance store (ephemeral) volumes such as (Z:). Data on instance storage will be lost when you stop your EC2 instance.

[[ip-addresses-on-the-exchange-nodes]]
==== IP Addresses on the Exchange nodes

By default, the Microsoft Exchange Quick Start template deploys two Exchange nodes with two IP addresses each:

* One IP address is used as the primary IP address for the instance.
* A second IP address acts as the Failover Cluster IP resource.

When you launch the AWS CloudFormation template, you can specify the addresses for each node, as shown in Figure 4. By default, the 10.0.0.0/19, 10.0.32.0/19, and 10.0.64.0/19 CIDR blocks are used for the private subnets.

[[database-availability-group]]
==== Database Availability Group

A failover cluster is automatically created for the database availability group (DAG). The AWS CloudFormation templates carry out this task when deploying the second node. If you use the default parameter settings in the template, the Quick Start runs the following Windows PowerShell commands to complete this task:

----
Install-WindowsFeature failover-clustering –IncludeManagementTools

New-DatabaseAvailabilityGroup -Name DAG -WitnessServer FileServer

-WitnessDirectory C:\DAG

Add-DatabaseAvailabilityGroupServer -Identity DAG

-MailboxServer ExchangeNode1

Add-DatabaseAvailabilityGroupServer -Identity DAG

-MailboxServer ExchangeNode2
----

*Note*: By default, the database availability group is created with the name DAG. To change this value, modify the DAGName default parameter value in the Configure-ExchangeDAG.ps1 file.

The first command runs on each instance during the bootstrapping process. It installs the required components and management tools for the failover clustering services. The rest of the commands run near the end of the bootstrapping process on the second node and are responsible for creating the cluster and for defining the server nodes and IP addresses.

By default, the Quick Start configures an even number of servers in the cluster. You need a third resource to maintain a majority vote to keep the cluster online if an individual server fails. For this, the Quick Start uses a dedicated file share witness instance, which can be either a domain-joined server or a third Exchange node (which cannot be part of the DAG itself). By default, the Quick Start creates a Dedicated Instance in the first Availability Zone to act as the file share witness. For production environments, you can also set the *Third AZ* parameter to *witness* to create a Dedicated Instance with a file share in a third Availability Zone.

Alternatively, you can use any domain-joined server for this task. (This isn’t included in the Quick Start.) If you set the *Third AZ* parameter to *full*, the Quick Start keeps the quorum settings to the default node majority and creates a third Exchange Server node in the third Availability Zone. Note that some AWS Regions support only two Availability Zones; for a current list, see https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/[AWS Global Infrastructure].

The Quick Start automated solution ends after creating the DAG and adding the two Exchange nodes to the DAG. When the deployment is complete, you can create additional databases and make them highly available by creating copies on the second nodes. This process is covered in link:#step-3.-optional-create-database-copies[step 3] of the deployment instructions.

[[edge-transport-nodes]]
==== Edge Transport Nodes

Edge Transport nodes relay inbound and outbound emails and provide smart host services within the Exchange organization. The Edge nodes are installed in the public subnets and aren’t domain-joined. However, they do require information from Active Directory, and configuring an Edge sync subscription is needed.

Because Edge Transport role nodes aren’t required for end-to-end mail flow, by default, Edge nodes aren’t deployed. For this to occur, you must select *yes* on the *Deploy Edge servers* launch option, as shown in the following figure:

[#architecture5]
.Deploying Edge servers
image::../docs/operational_guide/images/image5.png[Architecture,width=648,height=89]

A pair of Edge servers is deployed in the public subnets (which must be defined), and the Exchange Server Edge Transport role is installed using default settings. The EC2 instances aren’t domain-joined, but the DNS suffix that corresponds to the domain name is configured on the network interface cards (NICs). Also, DNS records are created in Active Directory corresponding to their hostname.

The Local Administrator password is reset to the Domain Admin password, and an Edge subscription file is created, which can be found in C:\EdgeServerSubscription.xml.

Copy the subscription file to a *mailbox* server, and import the subscription by running the following command:

New-EdgeSubscription -FileData ([byte[]]$(Get-Content -Path "C:\EdgeServerSubscription.xml" -Encoding Byte -ReadCount 0)) -Site "AZ1"

[[load-balancer]]
==== Load balancer

Exchange servers running with the Client Access/Transport roles are usually situated behind a network load balancer (NLB) with a unified Exchange namespace such as “mail.example.com.” The namespace resolves to the load balancer, which in turns distributes traffic to the Exchange servers.

The Exchange Server Quick Start contains an option to deploy an Application Load Balancer that distributes the traffic to the Exchange nodes.

By default, the load balancer isn’t deployed because it requires an existing SSL certificate to be imported in AWS Certificate Manager.

For a load balancer to be deployed, you must:

1.  Import or generate a certificate in AWS Certificate Manager.
2.  Specify the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in the CertificateARN option.
3.  Select *true* in *Deploy Load Balancer*, when you launch the Quick Start.

[[volume-encryption]]
==== Volume Encryption

As part of the default setup, the Exchange Server Quick Start creates and attaches two EBS volumes to each Exchange node. One EBS volume (corresponding to the D:\ drive) holds the Exchange mailbox databases, while the other EBS volume (E:\) holds the Exchange transaction logs.

Optionally, the Quick Start provides an option to encrypt the EBS volumes with either the default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption key or a custom KMS key, as shown in the following figure:

[#architecture6]
.Encrypting the EBS volumes
image::../docs/operational_guide/images/image5.png[Architecture,width=648,height=83]

*Note* The root volume of the Exchange nodes (C:\) isn’t encrypted, if *Encrypt data volumes* is selected.

//Should any sections not be applicable, remove them

=== Post-deployment steps
// If post-deployment steps are required, add them here. If not, remove the heading

==== Run Windows Updates

In order to ensure the deployed servers' operating systems and installed applications have the latest Microsoft updates, run Windows Update on each server.

1. Create an RDP session from the Remote Desktop Gateway server to each deployed server.
2. Open the *Settings* application.
3. Open *Update & Security*.
4. Click *Check for updates*.
5. Install any updates and reboot if necessary.

==== (Optional) Create database copies

The Quick Start creates a database availability group (DAG) and adds the Exchange nodes to the DAG. As part of the Exchange installation, each Exchange node contains a mailbox database. The first node contains a database called DB1, and the second node contains a database called DB2.

As part of configuring high availability for the mailbox roles, you can add mailbox database copies on the other Exchange nodes. Alternatively, you can create entirely new databases and only then create additional copies.

To create a second copy for the initial databases, use the following commands:

----
Add-MailboxDatabaseCopy -Identity DB1 –MailboxServer ExchangeNode2 -ActivationPreference 2

Add-MailboxDatabaseCopy -Identity DB2 –MailboxServer ExchangeNode1 -ActivationPreference 2
----

==== (Optional) Create a DNS entry for the load balancer

1.  If you chose the option to deploy a load balancer, the Network Load Balancer (NLB) will have an endpoint address such as [elb.amazonaws.com].
2.  To use the load balancer with your Exchange namespace, create a CNAME record in Active Directory that points to the ALB.
3.  Before proceeding, go to the https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home[Amazon EC2 console] and, under *Load balancer*, select the load balancer that the Quick Start created.
4.  Copy the value listed under the DNS name, as shown in Figure 7.

[#architecture7]
.Creating a DNS entry for the load balancer
image::../docs/operational_guide/images/image7.png[Architecture,width=646,height=275]

[start=5]
5.  To create the DNS record, connect using Remote Desktop to one of the domain controllers using domain credentials, and open the DNS console by going to the Start menu and typing “DNS”.
6.  In the DNS console, navigate to the Active Directory zone, right-click, and select *New Alias (CNAME)*, as shown in Figure 8.

[#architecture8]
.Selecting New Alias (CNAME)

[start=7]
7.  Create the DNS entry such as “mail” and in *fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for target host*, paste the value of the Application Load Balancer endpoint, as shown in Figure 9.

[#architecture9]
.Creating the DNS entry (“mail”)
image::../docs/operational_guide/images/image9.png[Architecture,width=422,height=480]

[start=8]
9.  Verify that the DNS entry is resolved successfully by performing an nslookup. Go to Start and type “cmd”. In the command line window, type the following:

Nslookup *mail*._example.com_

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Where mail is the name of the CNAME record you created, and “example.com” is your Active Directory domain name.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

[start=10]
10.  Ensure that the record resolves to the load balancer DNS record, such as shown in Figure 10.

== Best practices for using {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.

The architecture built by this Quick Start supports AWS best practices for high availability and security.

[[high-availability-and-disaster-recovery]]
==== High availability and disaster recovery

Amazon EC2 provides the ability to place instances in multiple locations composed of AWS Regions and Availability Zones. Regions are dispersed and located in separate geographic areas. Availability Zones are distinct locations within a Region that are engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones and that provide inexpensive, low-latency network connectivity to other Availability Zones in the same Region.

By launching your instances in separate Regions, you can design your application to be closer to specific customers or to meet legal or other requirements. By launching your instances in separate Availability Zones, you can protect your applications from the failure of a single location. Exchange provides infrastructure features that complement the high availability and disaster recovery scenarios supported in the AWS Cloud.

[[automatic-failover]]
==== Automatic failover

Deploying the Quick Start with the *default parameters* configures a two-node database availability group (DAG) with a file share witness. The DAG uses Windows Server Failover Clustering for automatic failover.

The Quick Start implementation supports the following scenarios:

* Protection from the failure of a single instance
* Automatic failover between the cluster nodes
* Automatic failover between Availability Zones

However, the Quick Start default implementation doesn’t provide automatic failover in every case. For example, the loss of Availability Zone 1, which contains the primary node and file share witness, would prevent automatic failover to Availability Zone 2. This is because the cluster would fail as it loses quorum. In this scenario, you could follow manual disaster recovery steps that include restarting the cluster service and forcing quorum on the second cluster node (e.g., ExchangeNode2) to restore application availability.

The Quick Start also provides an option to deploy into three Availability Zones. This deployment option can mitigate the loss of quorum in the case of a failure of a single node. However, you can select this option only in AWS Regions that include three or more Availability Zones; for a current list, see https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/[AWS Global Infrastructure].

We recommend that you consult the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/Exchange/exchange-server?view=exchserver-2019[Microsoft Exchange Server documentation] and customize some of the steps described in this guide or add ones (e.g., deploy additional cluster nodes and configure mailbox database copies) to deploy a solution that best meets your business, IT, and security requirements.

[[security-groups-and-firewalls]]
==== Security groups and firewalls

When the EC2 instances are launched, they must be associated with a security group, which acts as a stateful firewall. You have complete control over the network traffic entering or leaving the security group, and you can build granular rules that are scoped by protocol, port number, and source or destination IP address or subnet. By default, all traffic egressing a security group is permitted. Ingress traffic, on the other hand, must be configured to allow the appropriate traffic to reach your instances.

Domain controllers and member servers require several security group rules to allow traffic for services such as AD DS replication, user authentication, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/windows-time-service/windows-time-service-top[Windows Time service], and Distributed File System (DFS), among others. The nodes running Exchange Server permit full communication between each other, as recommended by Microsoft best practices. For more information, see https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/exchange/2013/02/18/exchange-firewalls-and-support-oh-my[Exchange, Firewalls, and Support].

Edge node servers (if configured to be deployed) allow port 25 TCP (SMTP) from the entire internet.

The Quick Start creates certain security groups and rules for you. For a detailed list of port mappings, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstart/latest/active-directory-ds/security.html[Security section] of the Active Directory Domain Services Quick Start deployment guide, and the link:#security[Security section] of this guide.

=== Security
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.

AWS provides a set of building blocks (for example, Amazon EC2 and Amazon VPC) that you can use to provision infrastructure for your applications. In this model, some security capabilities, such as physical security, are the responsibility of AWS and are highlighted in the https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-security-best-practices.pdf[AWS security whitepaper]. Other areas, such as controlling access to applications, fall on the application developer and the tools provided in the Microsoft platform.

This Quick Start configures the following security groups for Exchange Server:

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Security group |Associated with |Inbound source |Ports
|DomainMemberSGID |Exchange nodes, FileServer, RD Gateway, Domain controllers |VPC CIDR |Standard AD ports
