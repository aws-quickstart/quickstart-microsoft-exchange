Exchange Server can be deployed and licensed through https://aws.amazon.com/windows/mslicensemobility/[Microsoft License Mobility^]. For development and test environments, you can use your existing MSDN licenses for Exchange Server using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)–dedicated instances. For more information, refer to https://aws.amazon.com/windows/msdn/[Licensing—MSDN^].

This Quick Start deployment uses an evaluation copy of Exchange Server. To upgrade your version, see the Microsoft Exchange Server website.

This Quick Start launches the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for Microsoft Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019, and it includes the license for Windows Server. The AMI is regularly updated with the latest service pack, so there's no need update it. The Windows Server AMI doesn’t require client access licenses (CALs) and includes two Microsoft Remote Desktop Services licenses. For more information, refer to https://aws.amazon.com/windows/resources/licensing/[Microsoft Licensing on AWS^].

There is no cost to use this Quick Start, but you will be billed for any AWS services or resources that this Quick Start deploys. For more information, refer to the https://fwd.aws/rA69w?[AWS Quick Start General Information Guide^].
