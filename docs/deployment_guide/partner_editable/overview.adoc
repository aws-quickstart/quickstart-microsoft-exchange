This Quick Start deploys Microsoft Exchange on the AWS Cloud. If you are unfamiliar with AWS Quick Starts, refer to the https://fwd.aws/rA69w?[AWS Quick Start General Information Guide^].

Exchange Server is a messaging and collaboration solution that Microsoft developed, with support for mailboxes, calendars, compliance, and e-archival. In an Exchange Server environment, your users can collaborate and—when you deploy the environment in AWS—you can scale your environment based on demand.

The AWS Cloud provides infrastructure services that enable you to deploy Exchange Server in a highly available, fault-tolerant, and affordable way. By deploying on AWS, you get the functionality of Exchange Server and the flexibility and security of AWS.

In addition to this Quick Start, we’ve published a set of Microsoft-based Quick Starts that you can use to deploy other common Microsoft workloads on AWS, including:

* Microsoft Active Directory
* Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway)
* Microsoft SharePoint Server
* Microsoft Web Application Proxy with Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Windows Server Update Services

Each of those Quick Starts includes a virtual private cloud (VPC) environment, which is deployed based on AWS best practices. To read more about deploying Microsoft workloads by using our Quick Starts, see the https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/#microsoft_technologies[Quick Starts in the Microsoft Technologies category].
