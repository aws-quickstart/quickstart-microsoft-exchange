image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture,width=100%,height=100%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two or three Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Elastic IP addresses associated with the NAT gateway and RD Gateway instances.*
** Microsoft Windows Server–based RD Gateway instances, in an Auto Scaling group, and network address translation (NAT) gateways for outbound internet access.*
** (Optional) Exchange Edge Transport servers for routing email in and out of your environment.
* In the private subnets:
** Microsoft Active Directory domain controllers.*
** Windows Server–based Amazon EC2 instances as Exchange nodes.
** Exchange Server Enterprise on each node. This architecture provides redundancy and a witness server to ensure that a quorum is established.
* An internet gateway that connects the VPC to the internet.
* A Network Load Balancer that distributes incoming traffic across the Exchange Amazon EC2 instances. 
* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to store and retrieve data.
* AWS Secrets Manager to encrypt, store, and retrieve credentials for your databases and other services.
* A Parameter Store resource to provide hierarchical storage for configuration data management and secrets management.
* AWS Certificate Manager to provision, manage, and deploy SSL/TLS certificates on AWS managed resources.
